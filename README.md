Repository to hold Kernel code that can be used in exploitation or LPE's

All information exposed in this Github is free to use. The idea behind this is help others by providing code that works on newer versions of Windows 10 (RS3, RS4, RS4, 19H1 etc.)

All content is focused to share my years of experience with other security professionals who are interested in Kernel abuse.

It is your responsibility if you decide to use the information of this blog to make illegal actions. If you do that I am not to blame.
